Since then, Bitcoin has gone from a worthless digital currency to costing nearly $20,000 at its highest peak. It is understandable, then, that many have tried to <strong>forecast the price of Bitcoin</strong> over the years with the hope of profiting off of the currency&rsquo;s success.</p><p>In this project, we will attempt to forecast the price of Bitcoin using both simple and long short-term memory (<strong>LSTM</strong>) recurrent neural networks (<strong>RNNs</strong>), as well as <strong>Facebook&rsquo;s Prophet</strong> software. We will compare the relative accuracy of these predictive models in forecasting Bitcoin&rsquo;s 2020 prices based on historical prices, then attempt to forecast future prices using our most promising models.</p><h2 id=setup>Setup</h2><p>In this section, we will set up our environment by importing libraries, managing packages, and writing utility functions for later use.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> this project was developed in Google’s Colaboratory environment, so some of the setup code is specific to Colab’s environment.

This allows RNNs to use sequence information and, in a sense, have memory that considers prior inputs. In our case, this will allow our neural networks to make predictions on Bitcoin prices based on time-series data; our RNNs will be able to sequentially learn how Bitcoin prices change and, in turn, how these sequential changes lead to different y values [<a href=https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Feed-forward-and-recurrent-neural-networks_fig5_305881131>Image Source</a>].</p><p><img src=/images/posts/bitcoin-price-forecasting/rnn-vs-ff-nn.png class=center><div style=margin-top:rem></div></p><h4 id=simple-rnn>Simple RNN</h4><p>We will first build a very simple RNN that consists of a single RNN input layer and a Dense output layer.

There was a large drop in prices at the start of our test period, which our model did not seem to predict. Overall, it appears that our model seems to have averaged the price data over time, rather than actually predicting how the price will change.</p><p>One limitation of RNNs is that they face the <strong>vanishing gradient</strong> problem, which leads to RNNs having an issue of short-term memory. In short, as RNNs loop and process outputs as inputs, gradients have a tendency to become increasingly small during backpropogation. When gradients become smaller and smaller during backpropogation, the changes made to the neural network are also small, meaning that the neural network makes only small adjustments and therefore does not learn the training data properly.</p><p>Due to vanishing gradients, RNNs tend to have trouble retaining information from earlier steps in the sequence. This is likely the reason why our model did not make significant changes to the predicted price in either direction, even though prices did often increase or decrease drastically.</p><h4 id=long-short-term-memory-lstm-rnn>Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) RNN</h4><p>LSTMs are a subclass of RNNs that seeks to combat the problem of vanishing gradients and short-term memory. LSTMs contain &ldquo;gates&rdquo;, which are mechanisms that allow the LSTM to either keep or throw out previous data as the RNN runs loops. These gates, therefore, serve as the memory system for the LSTMs, and allow these models to integrate learnings from earlier values in the sequences. In our case, this will allow our Bitcoin forecasting model to hold on to information about earlier Bitcoin prices (specifically, up to 60 days before the price we are trying to predict). In the process of backpropogation, our models can learn to either forget or retain specific information based on how valuable it is for the purpose of predicting future outcomes.

We can see from our bottom graph, which focuses on the test period, that the predictions follow the trend of actual prices very closely, with a slight temporal delay. Overall, this model appears to have performed very well, especially when comparing to the simple RNN.</p><p>Best of all, this model was relatively easy and quick to train and only consists of one layer. While the concept of the LSTM is complex compared to feed-forward networks, the implementation was nonetheless very easy. This shows great promise for more advanced LSTM models, which may be able to improve further on this performance.</p><h3 id=facebook-prophet>Facebook Prophet</h3><p>The last model we will consider is <a href=https://facebook.github.io/prophet/>Facebook&rsquo;s open-source Prophet framework</a>. Prophet is a time-series forecasting procedure that is able to fit non-linear trends using an additive model that takes into consideration yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, as well as holidays. Prophet has shown great promise in recent years as a fast and powerful framework for making time-series predictions, and it is also very useful because it has out-of-box capabilities for taking seasonality and holidays into account.</p><p>One benefit of Prophet is that it requires minimal data preprocessing. We previously prepared train and test datasets for our RNN models, but Prophet&rsquo;s requirements are more lenient and thus we can use more intuitive data structures (such as our 2 column dataframes) as inputs.</p><pre><code># Prophet expects columns with names 'ds' and 'y'

We can see that the LSTM forecast very closely fits the actual Bitcoin prices. Our results suggest that LSTM models are relatively very promising for forecasting Bitcoin prices; however, because RNN/LSTM models require specific data structures and make predictions one day at a time based on x timesteps (in our case, 60), it is very difficult to make future forecasts. This is because the models are trained sequentially, and thus, if we were to make predictions 30 days into the future, our predictions would become increasingly inaccurate as they become more and more dependent on extrapolated data.</p><p>It is for this reason that we used the Prophet model to make predictions on future data, even though Prophet did not perform as well as LSTM on the actual 2020 data. Rather than training sequential learning models that are ideal for predicting one day at a time, Prophet focuses more on identifying linear and non-linear trends and seasonality.</p><h3 id=future-bitcoin-prices>Future Bitcoin Prices</h3><p>Let&rsquo;s revisit our future Bitcoin price forecast using Prophet.</p><pre><code># Use function to make future predictions

However, there are certainly significant limitations to consider here. While Prophet has the capacity to take seasonality into consideration, forecasting predictions should still be taken with a grain of salt, as these models are unable to consider world events and public perceptions. If there are major shifts in the perceptions of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, this may have an impact on prices. For example, if large companies continued to invest in Bitcoin, that would have a positive impact on Bitcoin prices; if, instead, companies decided to abandon Bitcoin, then that would likely result in a sharp decrease in Bitcoin prices.</p><p>Despite the limitations, the Prophet model is still promising for enthusiasts who are curious about where Bitcoin&rsquo;s prices will go in the near future. Does this mean that we should make Bitcoin trading decisions based on these models? Not so much.</p><h2 id=takeaways>Takeaways</h2><p>In this project, we developed three models for the prediction of Bitcoin prices. We found that our LSTM model had the strongest performance in predicting prices sequentially, but our Prophet model was able to learn general trends that may be more useful for long-term forecasting. We used the Prophet model to predict prices 3 months into the future, and found that Bitcoin prices are likely to stay relatively stable, with a slight upward trend.</p><p>The goal of this project was to explore the capacity of various models to forecast Bitcoin prices, and we were very successful in this regard. We found that our LSTM and Prophet forecasts were able to accurately predict Bitcoin prices, suggesting that there are instrinsic characteristics of Bitcoin market trends that can be understood through modeling. The results of our analysis suggest that these novel forecasting techniques hold great promise for the future, despite significant limitations that remain at present day.</p></div><div class=btn-improve-page><a href=https://github.com/naingthet/naingthet.github.io/edit/master/content/posts/bitcoin-price-forecasting/bitcoin-price-forecasting.md><i class="fas fa-code-branch"></i>Improve this page</a></div><hr><div class="row next-prev-navigator"><div class="col-md-12 next-article"><a href=/posts/fraud/fraud/ class="btn btn-outline-info"><span>Next <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-right"></i></span><br><span>Credit Card Fraud Detection</span></a></div></div><hr></div></div></div></section><section class=toc-section id=toc-section><div class=toc-holder><h5 class="text-center pl-3">Table of Contents</h5><hr><div class=toc><nav id=TableOfContents><ol><li><a href=#introduction>Introduction</a></li><li><a href=#setup>Setup</a><ol><li><a href=#imports>Imports</a></li><li><a href=#loading-the-data>Loading the Data</a></li></ol></li><li><a href=#data-preprocessing-and-analysis>Data Preprocessing and Analysis</a><ol><li><a href=#creating-time-series-datasets>Creating time-series datasets</a></li></ol></li><li><a href=#forecasting-2020-bitcoin-prices>Forecasting 2020 Bitcoin Prices</a><ol><li><a href=#recurrent-neural-networks-rnns>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)</a><ol><li><a href=#simple-rnn>Simple RNN</a></li><li><a href=#long-short-term-memory-lstm-rnn>Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) RNN</a></li></ol></li><li><a href=#facebook-prophet>Facebook Prophet</a></li></ol></li><li><a href=#forecasting-future-bitcoin-prices>Forecasting Future Bitcoin Prices</a></li><li><a href=#discussion>Discussion</a><ol><li><a href=#2020-bitcoin-prices>2020 Bitcoin Prices</a></li><li><a href=#future-bitcoin-prices>Future Bitcoin Prices</a></li></ol></li><li><a href=#takeaways>Takeaways</a></li></ol></nav></div></div></section></div><footer class="container-fluid text-center align-content-center footer pb-2"><div class="container pt-5"><div class="row text-left"><div class="col-md-4 col-sm-12"><h5>Navigation</h5><ul><li class=nav-item><a class=smooth-scroll href=#about>About</a></li><li class=nav-item><a class=smooth-scroll href=#skills>Skills</a></li><li class=nav-item><a class=smooth-scroll href=#experiences>Experiences</a></li><li class=nav-item><a class=smooth-scroll href=#projects>Projects</a></li><li class=nav-item><a class=smooth-scroll href=#recent-posts>Recent Posts</a></li></ul></div><div class="col-md-4 col-sm-12"><h5>Contact me:</h5><ul><li><span>Email:</span> <span>naing.thet97@gmail.com</span></li><li><span>Phone:</span> <span>+13109937103</span></li></ul></div></div></div><hr><div class=container><div class="row text-left"><div class=col-md-4><a id=theme href=https://github.com/hossainemruz/toha target=#><img src=/assets/images/inverted-logo.png>
